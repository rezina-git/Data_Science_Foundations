Welcome to my learning repository: Data Science Foundations. 

This repo documents my step-by-step journey as I build a strong foundation in 
data science-the first essential step toward my ultimate goal: working in the 
field of Artificial Intelligence (AI).

ðŸŽ¯ Why I'm Learning This
My long-term goal is to work in AI. But before diving into advanced topics like deep learning or neural networks, I believe it's crucial to understand the core principles of data â€” how to collect, clean, analyze, and draw insights from it.

Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™ve started here, learning the fundamentals of data science.

ðŸ§  What I'm Covering
Hereâ€™s what this repo includes:

1.NumPy
2.Arrays, broadcasting, math operations
3.Pandas
4.DataFrames, cleaning, filtering, groupby
5.Matplotlib & Seaborn
6.Creating visualizations from data
7.Statistics
8.Mean, median, standard deviation, probability
